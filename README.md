# 🧠 Hazeeb's DSA Practice

Welcome to my Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) practice repository.  
This is where I upload solutions to problems I've solved while preparing for technical interviews and improving my algorithmic thinking.

## 📌 Goals
- Strengthen my problem-solving skills
- Build confidence for technical interviews
- Develop consistency in daily DSA practice
- Cover key topics across arrays, trees, graphs, and more

## 🗂️ Structure



Each folder contains:
- Problem statement (if needed)
- My code solution
- Comments or explanation (if necessary)
